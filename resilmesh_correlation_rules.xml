<!--
Optional but nice to have rules, you can add them to your Wazuh instance, usually in https://127.0.0.1:4343/app/rules#/manager/?tab=ruleset
assuming "https://127.0.0.1:4343" is your Wazuh Dashboard, you can also manually add them to /var/ossec/etc/rules in your Wazuh server.
Don't forget to restart the Wazuh Manager with "systemctl restart wazuh-manager" command
